## What is this? 

Have you ever sat through a pre-recorded Powerpoint presentation (3P) and wondered
when it would end? Would you like to put a 3P in the bin immediately if it is
longer that the 'maximum time' limit set in the candidate brief? Have you ever
made a 3P and wondered whether it would annoy the interviewers because of its
length? 

## pptx_duration

Pre-recorded Powerpoint presentations do not automatically come with a 'timer'
and so it isn't immediately obvious how long a recorded presentation is. This
simple Python script unzips the .pptx and determines the runtime for you. 

## Usage
```
pip install pptx_duration
python pptx_duration PATH_TO_PPTX

Total Time = 0:10:00

```
